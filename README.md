# House-Price-Prediction
A ML project to predict house prices using regression in Python. Including:
* Exploratory data analysis.
* Data preprocessing, visualization and cleaning.
* Labeling categorical data into binary vectors.
* Accurately splitting data into training and testing.
* Calculating loss via Mean Absolute Percentage Error = $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n |y_i-\hat{y_i}|$, where $y_i$ is the predicted and $\hat{y_i}$ is the actual value.
* Comparing accuracy between different regressor models (SVM, Random Forest, and Linear Regression + CatBoost Classifier).

Libraries used:
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* sklearn
